Hi Zain,

As of now. I read about the blockchain technologies, Solidity programming language used to build smart contracts.

Please read about Ethereum crowdfunding.

https://ethereum.org/ (Kickstart a project with a trustless crowdsale)

I have 2 ideas

1 - We have to think about a project under blockchain technology (Insurance, Bidding, Raising funds).
--------After building the app we can create tokens (Virtual shares) and sell it via crowdfunding.

2 - We can be a blockchain company and help others to create and deploy the crowdfunding
